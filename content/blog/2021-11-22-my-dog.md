My dog's name is Atlas, he is a Standard Australian Shepherd, we got him from a farm by Edmonton last year of November 11, 2020, it was Remembrance Day. Atlas was only 6.5 weeks old when we took him home, he was the biggest of the litter and the shiest dog. He is a two-tone dog, brown and white, not the most popular colour known with Australian Shepherds, but I love him just the way he is.



Atlas is very playful and his favourite toy was his plaid blanket that I bought his dad for Christmas that year, not really sure why since dogs only see blue and yellow but this one is red plaid.  



Atlas was born in September 25, 2020 and is now 1.2 years old. He is now a big boy at 60 lbs, not usual for Australian Shepherds to hit their maximum size but he came from a line of herders. He has tons of energy, we walk about four times a day.
