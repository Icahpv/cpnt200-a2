I bought blanky for Atlas' dad on Christmas of 2019. Blanky is a red plaid blanket, it's one of those furry and soft blankets. Atlas loved this blanket to the point where it goes wherever he is, when he goes out to the backyard to watch the squirrels and cats, he brings it with him, when he's home alone, he carries it wherever he feels like sleeping and when somebody comes home, he brings them the blanket to play with. His original blanket was destroyed just after 6 months of having him, he played with it a lot to the point where it's all torn apart, we still kept the pieces and he still drags it around. His grandma found the same exact blanket and gave it in advance to him for Christmas. It didn't take a while for him to start carrying it again all over the place.
